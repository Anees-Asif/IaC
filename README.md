# Configuration Management

Configuration management is the systematic control of changes to an organization's software and hardware to ensure consistency and reliability. It includes version control, change management, and auditing.

# Orchestration with Terraform

## What

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure efficiently. Orchestration with Terraform involves describing your infrastructure as code, which enables automation, version control, and reusability.

## Where

Terraform can be used across multiple environments:

- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.
- **On-Premises**: VMWare, OpenStack
- **Hybrid Environments**: A mix of cloud and on-premises resources
- **Other Services**: Database providers, DNS providers, monitoring services, and more

## Why

1. **Automation**: Manually setting up infrastructure can be error-prone and time-consuming. Terraform automates this process.
2. **Version Control**: You can track changes, rollback, and view the history of your infrastructure.
3. **Modularity and Reusability**: Write once, use everywhere. Modules in Terraform allow you to reuse configurations.
4. **Multi-Provider Support**: Ability to manage diverse resources from different providers cohesively.
5. **Cost Savings**: By automating the creation and destruction of resources, you can save on operational costs.

## When

- **New Projects**: Start with a codified infrastructure from day one.
- **Migration**: When moving to a new provider or just reorganizing your current setup.
- **Scale**: As your application grows, Terraform makes it easier to manage more complex infrastructure needs.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: For continuous delivery and continuous deployment.

## How

### Installation

Download the appropriate package from the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and install it.

### Initialization

Create a new directory and initialize Terraform:

```bash
mkdir my_terraform_project
cd my_terraform_project
terraform init
```

### Configuration

Create a `main.tf` file to describe your infrastructure. For example, provisioning an AWS EC2 instance:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### Plan and Apply

Preview changes and apply them:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice where infrastructure resources are managed and provisioned using code and automation. It replaces manual configuration with code to improve efficiency and consistency in managing and scaling infrastructure.

## Diagram of IaC

The diagram represents a cloud infrastructure setup that uses a hybrid approach and utilizes Ansible for configuration management and orchestration. 
   
1. **Load Balancing and Disaster Recovery**:
   - If there's an issue with AWS, traffic will be load balanced and redirected to Azure.
   
2. **Ansible Controller**: 
   - At the center of the diagram is the Ansible Controller. Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
   
3. **SSH**: 
   - In the diagram, SSH is shown connecting various components, indicating that Ansible is using SSH for executing commands.
   
4. **Ansible Vault Authentication**: 
   - Ansible Vault is a feature of Ansible that allows users to keep sensitive data encrypted rather than as plaintext.
      
5. **Environment Variable**: 
   -  Environment variables are often used to store configuration settings and sensitive information and is being passed to mongodb
   
6. **Database running on MongoDB**: 
   -  The diagram shows that the Node.js application interfaces with a MongoDB instance.



In summary, the diagram illustrates a hybrid cloud setup that utilizes multiple cloud providers. Ansible is central to the orchestration, configuration, and deployment of applications and resources in this setup. The infrastructure prioritizes load balancing, disaster recovery, and security.
